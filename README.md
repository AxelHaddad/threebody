# threebody

A simple simulation of the three-body problem in python.

Re-reading Liu Cixin's Three-Body Problem, wanted to make this to visualize the three-body problem.

## How to run

Install [pygame](https://pypi.org/project/pygame/), then run `threebody.py` with python3 (it works with 3.11).

You can tweak the initial conditions in the `threebody.py` file.

Do not hesitate to run it several times, even with the same initial conditions, the result is never twice the same (I guess it's because of the duration of the loop step).
