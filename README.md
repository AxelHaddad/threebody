# threebody

A simple simulation of the three-body problem in python.

Re-reading Liu Cixin's Three-Body Problem, wanted to make this to visualize the three-body problem.

## How to run

Install [pygame](https://pypi.org/project/pygame/), then run `threebody.py` with python3 (it works with 3.11).

You can change the number of stars in the `threebody.py` file. Although there's no optimisations whatsoever it should work fine with 100 stars.
